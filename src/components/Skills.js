        <p className={classes.contentp}>My interest in web development started in 2021 when I decided to build websites using Shopify, Wordpress, and Squarespace. I soon realized that I enjoyed building things on the internet that were colourful and interactive. This led me to dive deeper into the world of web development by learning more technologies to further develop my web development skills. My work focuses on using Front-end technologies to create captivating web-applications through meaningful and engaging user-experiences.</p>
